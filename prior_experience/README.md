## A Boy and His Umbrella

I put together a little team of Westerdals students—from game programming, game design, and 3D Graphics—and my former composing partner to work on a 3D platformer inspired by the likes of *Super Mario 64* and *Banjo-Kazooie*.

On this project, I am in charge of the camera and character controller. While most of the work has been through Unity Collaborate, I have created a little separate repo for the camera [here](https://github.com/TheHeartmann/3D_third-person_camera), where the character is using an early version of the character controller.

The character controller is designed to be completely physics based, so as to interact most naturally with events and the environments, though this of course brings with it its own set of challenges.

## Pathfinding starting point for Game AI

I quickly cobbled together a Unity project for pathfinding in Unity for to module PG4500 Game AI, where a maze is generated at game startup, and where an agent will navigate towards wherever the user clicks to place a target. This ended up not being used for the module, but was a fun little task anyway. It can be found [here](https://github.com/TheHeartmann/PG4500_pathfinding)

## PJ3100 Project Software Engineering

In the module Project Software Engineering, the group I am part of has been working on developing a VR property viewing for DNB. I have taken part both in the creation of the Unity part of the project, as well as the accompanying website.

## Misc

I am also working on recreating certain features that I have found to be particularly exciting and innovative. I'm currently developing a portal system as seen in the *Portal* games and a gravity system as the one from the *Super Mario Galaxy* games. These are mainly personal projects for my own development and understanding of their concepts, although I would be very interested in incorporating them in an actual project at some point.


### Game Jams

Over the course of the last year, I have participated in a number of game jams, both as a programmer and as a composer. Of particular note is Audio Game Jam, where teams develop games for visually impaired players, Global Gam Jam 2017, and InnoGames Jam 2016 (at Gamescom in Germany), where my team, WoodFæry Interactive, ran off with one of the spots for [Best Overall Games](https://press.innogames.com/innogames-gamescom-game-jam-births-39-impressive-projects) for *Haywire*.

## Games Composer

Before starting my degree in game programming, I graduated from the Liverpool Institute for Performing Arts with a BA in music, focusing on performance and composition, and have been writing for games since around August 2014.
In January 2016, [Paul Zimmermann](http://www.paul-zimmermann.com/) and I founded Sounds for Pixels. As Sounds for Pixels, we created music and sfx for a variety of indie games, such as [Caveblazers](http://store.steampowered.com/app/452060/Caveblazers/) (who recently picked up a publisher) and [The Shortest Journey](http://gamejolt.com/games/the-shortest-journey/149463).
I left Sounds for Pixels in December to focus more on programming, but have kept a close ties to Paul, and we are currently in the planning phase of a little Android game.
